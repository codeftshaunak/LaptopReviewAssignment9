When it did, I only managed to get on the waitlist-- my husband didn't even get that. Being on the waitlist ended up being worthless since I never got notified of it being available again, despite literally sitting on my computer all day, minus short 5-minute respites.  Terribly disappointing, and it was even more frustrating to be offered to purchase one for $179 instead. My husband wanted to get me one for my birthday later this month, but I won't let him buy one for the $179 after missing out on this deal and wasting all day. I realize that there was a limit to the number offered, but obviously that number was way too small, upsetting a lot of very loyal Prime members. It's really a shame to cause that amount of ill-will.",
